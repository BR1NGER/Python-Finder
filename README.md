# Python-Finder

This code snippet demonstrates a recipe finder application using Python and an imaginary recipe API. It includes two functions: search_recipes to search for recipes based on a query, and get_recipe to retrieve details of a specific recipe based on its ID. The functions make HTTP requests to the API, handle the responses, and display the recipe information.

Please note that the URLs and API endpoints used in this example are placeholders and you would need to replace them with actual endpoints of a recipe API.
